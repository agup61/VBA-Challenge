# Stock Analysis
The Stock Analysis repository includes a VBA script that scrutinizes stocks in an Excel workbook for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 on a year-by-year basis. The script computes the yearly variation from the opening to the closing price for each stock and its unique ticker symbol. It also calculates the percentage shift and total stock volume for every stock. Additionally, the script identifies the stocks with the highest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume for each financial year. The script works on all worksheets within the workbook.


# How to use
To use the VBA script, first download the Excel workbook with the stock data separated by each financial year. Then, enable the Developer tab and open the Visual Basic Editor. Insert a new module, copy and paste the script from the repository, and press F5 to execute the script. The output analysis for each year will appear in specific columns on the corresponding worksheet, and this will occur across every worksheet in the workbook.


# Notes
* The stock data must be arranged in specific columns including ticker symbol, date, opening price, high price, low price, closing price, and total stock volume.
* The data must be separated by year, with each year in a separate worksheet for the script to work accurately.
* If the data is arranged differently, modifying the VBA script might be necessary to achieve the desired results.
